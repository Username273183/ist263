    My name is Omar Camara and Iâ€™m a computer science major. What interests me about this major is the problem-solving aspect of it, particularly trying to find the most efficient algorithms to find a solution. Some skills I have are programming, problem-solving and communication. I enjoy soccer and basketball, taking nature walks, and playing video games like rocket league on my free time.
